              Statement of Alleged Violations and Domestic and International
              Proceeding, as well as any other documents you wish the Court to

                Applicants have to support their complaints by documentary
                evidence. This means that if there is a complaint about an
                official act or decision, a copy of that decision or document
                attesting to that official act or measure must be provided. The
                Court cannot just take the word of applicants for what they say
                has happened. So, if an applicant complains that his house is
                being expropriated, he must attach to the application form a
                copy of the official decision ordering the expropriation; if an
                applicant alleges that she has been refused legal aid for her
                child custody proceedings, she must provide a copy of the
                document by the decision body setting out that refusal. If there
                are a number of documents relating to a particular incident or
                procedure, an applicant should err on the side of caution and
                provide all that appear relevant. <br /><br />
                If you are unable to obtain a copy of a decision or document,
                you should explain this in the application form. But you must
                show that it was practically impossible for you to obtain the
                document: applicants are expected to take reasonable steps to
                apply to authorities for copies of documents and to comply with
                reasonable formalities in that respect. If the explanation is
                not forthcoming or adequate, the application will not be
                allocated to a judicial formation.
                <br /><br />
                Where documents are provided by electronic means, they must be
                in the format required by this practice direction; they must
                also be arranged and numbered in accordance with the list of
                documents on the application form.
                <br /><br />
                <b>REMINDER:</b> It is the applicantâ€™s responsibility to take
                steps in good time to obtain all the information and documents
                required for a complete application. If you do not provide one
                or more of the necessary documents your application will not be
                regarded as complete and it will not be examined by the Court,
                unless you have given an adequate explanation of why you were
                unable to provide the missing document(s). Please note that for
                safety reasons, applications containing suspicious objects will
                be destroyed.
