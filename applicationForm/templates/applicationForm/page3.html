                            <p align="Justify">eComms is a service initiated by the Court for communicating electronically with an applicant’s representative.
                             The service is only activated if and when the case reaches a stage of the proceedings where the Government concerned are requested to submit written observations. 
                            The email address provided will be used to create an eComms account. It is recommended that representatives working in a law firm provide a generic email address so that the account can be used by multiple users within the firm.
                             You should inform the Court of any change to your eComms account email address. For more information, please refer to the terms and conditions available on the eComms website (https://ecomms.echr.coe.int), as well as the Practice Direction on electronic filing by applicants
                              (www.echr.coe.int/practicedirections) (available in English and French only).

                            <p align="Justify">eComms is a service initiated by the Court for communicating electronically with an applicant’s representative. 
                            The service is only activated if and when the case reaches a stage of the proceedings where the Government concerned are requested to submit written observations.
                            The email address provided will be used to create an eComms account. 
                            It is recommended that representatives working in a law firm provide a generic email address so that the account can be used by multiple users within the firm. 
                            You should inform the Court of any change to your eComms account email address. For more information, please refer to the terms and conditions available on the eComms website (https://ecomms.echr.coe.int), 
                            as well as the Practice Direction on electronic filing by applicants (www.echr.coe.int/practicedirections) (available in English and French only).
